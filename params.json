{"name":"Blimp","tagline":"Blind maps ftw!","body":"blimp\r\n=====\r\n\r\n#About\r\nSo far blimp is a proof-of-concept application, built as a christmas present for my girlfriend chr. She's absolutely nuts about blind maps. \r\n\r\nNext for Blimp is to make it to GitHub as a shared repository, and maybe get some further development in order to allow better gameplay.\r\n\r\nFor now the memory takes a hit when too many countries are involved (due to the detailed vectors), but hopefully I'll be able to sort it out. Other quirks to be solved are loading-indicators, saving, entering of name, share result, doge-graphics and so on.\r\n\r\n#Sources\r\nMost of the actual data here comes from the astonishing \r\nMohammed Le Doze's repository https://mledoze.github.io/countries/. \r\n\r\nThe map is built with Leaflet with amazing tiles from mapbox.com and the new approximative spellchecking is straightly from fuzzyset.js-repository.\r\n\r\n/foag (daniel@ikoncept.se)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
