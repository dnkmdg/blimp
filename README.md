blimp

#About
So far blimp is a proof-of-concept application, built as a christmas present for my girlfriend chr. She's absolutely nuts about blind maps. 

Next for Blimp is to make it to GitHub as a shared repository, and maybe get some further development in order to allow better gameplay.

For now the memory takes a hit when too many countries are involved (due to the detailed vectors), but hopefully I'll be able to sort it out. Other quirks to be solved are loading-indicators, saving, entering of name, share result, doge-graphics and so on.

#Sources
Most of the actual data here comes from the astonishing 
Mohammed Le Doze's repository https://mledoze.github.io/countries/. 

The map is built with Leaflet with amazing tiles from mapbox.com and the new approximative spellchecking is straightly from fuzzyset.js-repository.
